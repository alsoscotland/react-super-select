## A note on accessibility
Aria support for accessibility is a clear objective for this control. Finding clear and accurate information regarding cross-device accessibility practices is proving difficult to come by.  If you are a daily screen-reader user, or if you have particular expertise regarding accessibility, I would love to get your input on how to make the control better.

## Installation

The easiest way to use react-super-select is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `lib/react-super-select.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

via npm:
```
npm install react-super-select --save
```

via bower:
```
bower install react-super-select
```

## Dependencies
React-Super-Select requires 
  - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)
  - [classNames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)
  - [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)

## Usage

To use react super-select (jsx), require the module in your source code, and add a ReactSuperSelect element with a combination of the properties listed in the [API docs](http://alsoscotland.github.io/react-super-select/) or the [Annotated Source](http://alsoscotland.github.io/react-super-select/annotated-source.html)

```js
var ReactSuperSelect = require('react-super-select');
```
